        "cevap": "Sister, in the Qur'an, the verses on hijab are actually the answer for every one of us. Of course, fathers and mothers are the ones who should be obeyed, but obedience to Allah comes before everything. Therefore, you shouldn\u2019t listen to them in haram wishes. However, you must obey them in their halal requests.\n\nAs a result, a woman should not follow the requests of her family who oppose her hijab, because Allah has the final word on her. And it is our deeds, it is the situations in which we submit to Allah's commands that will help us in the grave, on the Sirat Bridge, in the Hereafter. My sister, we need to pay attention to Allah's commands. When we put on the hijab, we should do it without saying hurtful words that will break someone's heart. \n\n(The Prophet (pbuh) said) \u2018\u2019If an act of disobedience to Allah is imposed, one should not listen to or obey it.\u2019\u2019 As stated in another hadith \u201cThere is no obedience to anyone if it is disobedience to Allah. Verily, obedience is only in good conduct.\u201d\nI hope we can move forward in the light of these recommendations InshAllah.\n\nYou can also watch this short video for motivation, Sister;\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Bvi418m4ySk",

It is even a great blessing to have this desire in you, may Allah guide you to practice it in your life.\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\n\nOf course, it is important for every woman to dress beautifully and to be liked, because that is in our fitrah, that is how we were created, sister. However, in this world, we should guide our every wish and desire, even our needs, in the direction of Allah (swt)'s sake. We must abide by the boundaries of haram and halal, and the most important thing for us should be our value, our rank, our beauty in the sight of Allah.\n\nWhat we mean is, does Allah like you to reveal yourself in the presence of every foreign man?, or does He like you to reveal yourself only to your husband, who is your legitimatel partner? Because making up and dressing up for your husband can also be a way of seeking Allah's pleasure.\n\nWhat we really have to care about, sister, is this: the pleasure of Allah. Moreover, hijab does not take away beauty or make a person ugly, it only allows us to hide our beauty and reveal it only in the presence of those that Allah allows. There is also a lot of wisdom behind the Hijab, such as protection from evil looks and maintaining family unity and strength. In short, let's silence all contrary voices and listen to the call of our Rabb, and let's run on the path that makes it possible to earn His pleasure, insha'Allah, sister\".\ud83d\ude0a",

        "cevap": "My sister, the main thing in a Muslim woman's clothing is to maintain the hijab. She should cover her entire body except for her hands and face; she should not be exposed. In order for a garment to be proper for the hijab, it must be thick enough not to show underneath and long enough to cover the parts of the 'awrah (every part of the body except hands and face). \n\nTherefore, a dress that is thin and transparent in a way that shows underneath is not a proper covering. If we say this in points;\n\n\u25aa\ufe0fShe must be wearing outer clothing in a public place.\n\u25aa\ufe0fIt shouldn't cover just one part of the body; it should cover the whole body.\n\u25aa\ufe0fThe garment should not attract attention; it should be simple and modest..\n\u25aa\ufe0f It should be thick and should not show the skin. It should not be too tight to show body lines; it should be very wide and loose.\n\u25aa\ufe0fThe dress should not look like the one of the opposite gender; it should be in accordance with her personality and character. \n\u25aa\ufe0f It should be clean and decent, not dirty and torn.\n\u25aa\ufe0fShe should not smell in a way that appeals to people.\n\u25aa\ufe0f There should be no extremes in her behavior and especially in the way she walks; there should be dignity.\n\u25aa\ufe0fIn her voice and words, she should not be seductive or tempting; she should be serious and dignified.\n\u25aa\ufe0fThe hijab should not be tied in such a way that the neck is exposed and it can slide back from the head.\n\u25aa\ufe0fAs the verse states \"...to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests\u2026\u2019 (Surah An-Nur - 31)\u2019 The cover should conceal the necks in accordance with the command.\n\u25aa\ufe0f A bonnet must be worn under the headscarf and no hair must be visible.\n\nYou can read the detailed fatwa on this subject from the link I will send you, sister.\n\nhttps:\/\/questionsonislam.com\/article\/how-should-womans-outside-covering-be-what-extent-can-hands-and-feet-be-uncovered-how-should",

        "cevap": "My sister, the command of covering was first sent to men, so that they could keep their eyelids from seeing the haram. After that, women were given the responsibility of covering as it was not a one-sided solution.In this case, a man cannot say \"Let the woman cover why I have the responsibility not to look at her.\n\nSimilarly, a woman cannot say \"let the man not look, why should I carry the responsibility?\" Both sides have a responsibility. If everyone accepts the responsibility assigned to them and implements it,InshAllah, there will be no problem.\n\nLet's talk about the headscarf. The headscarf is a wholeness, it covers the whole body from head to toe, sister. Therefore, leaving the hair open and keeping the body covered would be meaningless in both appearance and meaning.\n\nOur Rabb, who knows us better than we know ourselves, has created everything as it should be, and has set right rules for them, each of which is full of wisdom. Headscarf is one of them, so we should try to learn how we can apply it instead of arguing against it, especially when it comes to the obligatory ones.\n\nMy sister, I also recommend you to watch this video;\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/aXmCbUqmkx8?si=skzneyNTDIE5b97G",

Everyone's hardships are different and everyone is tested differently.\n\nLet's first look at the reasons that make you want to take off the hijab. Is it your friends, is it what you watch or listen to, or is it your family? After determining that, you need to get rid of that environment or those elements. If it's your friends, you should get away from them, and if it's the movies or TV shows you watch, you should stop watching them.\n\nWhatever we are busy with, our mind, our subconscious mind, becomes busy with it, and after a while we surrender to it, that is, we become attached to it. Therefore, we need to choose carefully anything that keeps us occupied, does it endanger my world and my hereafter or not? We need to examine it closely.\n\nNow, my sister, it is up to you to get rid of these things and replace them with the right ones. Making friends who wear hijab, watching conversations about the importance of hijab, reading books about it, being in places where the name of Allah is mentioned, participating in congregations will help you in this sense, insha'Allah.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nMay Allah help you for the rest of your life, and may He not make you surrender to the devil and your nafs. \ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb",

But that doesn't mean you can't choose your spouse and marry someone you don't want. We are in a test and since we do not know what we will experience in the future, we can do our best on the halal path without going haram. For example, let's say a person wants to get married, he cannot go on a haram date and say that he is looking for his future wife.\n\nThis is because our Rabb has informed us of the haram and the halal and has commanded us to follow the halal path. The person who wants to get married follows the halal way and does his best, and then after asking our Lord in prayer, the only thing left is tawakkul.

If you are in such communication, you must leave the haram and stop the contact.\n\nIslam has required the spouses to maintain the marriage bond and the atmosphere of mutual love and respect as much as possible, has considered talaq (divorce) as a legitimate solution to be resorted to only when marriage is no longer possible, and has not found it appropriate to remain married on paper while living apart in heart and body as seen in some legal systems.\n\nBesides, \"The most hated of permissible things to Allah is divorce. \" (narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Umar): and \"Marry, but do not divorce; Allah does not love men and women who marry and divorce for pleasure.\" (al-Haythami, Majma al-Zawahid, 4\/335) such hadiths clearly state that divorce is considered to be religiously disliked.\n\nSatan tries his best to make haram look sweet to us, but there is no happiness in real sense in haram. It brings sorrow both in this world and in the hereafter. Ending a marriage arbitrarily, unless there is an important reason, is not suggested in Islam. There are verses and hadiths that advise men to get along well with their wives and try to focus on their good qualities rather than their bad qualities.\n\nMaybe this situation will change if you see the positive sides of your spouse and give all your energy to your spouse, we don't know.

But what do you do if someone eats it without your permission and says ''What's the big deal?''\n\nAllah has forbidden us to wander with the opposite gender without permission. And to get permission, one must get married.\n\nMy friend, the strong love and devotion in our hearts is for our Rabb, who is eternal. Our hearts cannot be satisfied with anything that is mortal. This means that the heart is a door to eternal life. It is not pleased with this mortal world. Besides, if we do not keep ourselves busy with the truth, the falsehood will occupy us. Satan will take advantage of our free time, the images we see, and the weakness of our faith to draw us to haram.\n\nAs Muslims, we must be cautious and not fall into it, and we must always be in fight against Satan and the nafs.We should stick to our prayers, learn knowledge, and improve our faith so that we can stand firm against haram. When bad thoughts overwhelm us, we should engage in Salawat and Dhikr, take Wudu (ablution) and recite the Qur'an, and turn our focus away from the thoughts that Satan gives us.\n\nLet us give our love to Allah, the true owner of the heart, and let us seek and intend to attain happiness in this world and the hereafter. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb",

Right now your heart is hurting, you are sad, yes, but in reality your Lord has saved you from a haram, alhamdulillah.\n\nYou will understand this better when your sadness disappears after a while, Insha'Allah.

Imagine you are washing dishes in a laundry machine. In this situation, you would damage the machine and the dishes in it. The laundry machine wouldn't know what happened to it, right?\n\nThe heart is just like that, we have to put the love of Allah in the center of the heart so that there is nothing against the natural disposition.

A tafsir is an explanation of the Qur'an. \n\nWe cannot fully understand the verses of the Qur'an, there are verses that are clear to everyone and there are verses whose meaning is not obvious to everyone. If we want to fully understand the Qur'an when we read it, we need to know the Arabic language and many other subjects such as sirah (The Life of Prophet Muhammad), hadith, and fiqh, but unfortunately we do not have enough knowledge. Of course, we can read the translations, but they are not enough.\n\nThat is why we need tafseers to help us understand the Qur'an, because tafseers provide a better understanding of the Qur'an because they go into the verses in more detail. Also, even the smallest work and deed done for the sake of Allah doesn't remain without results. Especially one of the greatest miracles of the universe, the Qur'an, will never go unrewarded when you try to understand it.\n\nEven looking at the pages of the Qur'an is rewarded by Allah, then of course it is also rewarded to read a book that gives the understanding of the Qur'an. But there is a difference between reading the Qur'an from the original and reading it from a translation. The most important method is to learn to read the Qur'an in Arabic and then read it from a translation in order to understand its meaning.\n\nThe word of Allah is in Arabic. It has a different value and reward. Each letter is rewarded many times over when you read it in Arabic.",

Even if it is just a little bit. Reciting the Qur'an is one of the greatest acts of worship that we Muslims must perform.\n\nJust think about it, a book has descended to us, there are hundreds of verses as our Lord\u2019s message to us, but we don't look at those verses and messages, we don't read them. In fact, we must read, understand and learn from the Qur'an every day, but if we are too lazy to read it even in Arabic, if we don't read it regularly, we should think, \"Where are we going?\" \ud83d\ude14 \ud83d\ude14 \n\nThe Messenger of Allah said: \"Read the Qur'an, for it will come as an intercessor for its reciters on the Day of Resurrection.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari 5027, Book 66, Hadith 49).\n\n\u201cThe house in which the Quran is recited is attended by the angels, the devils leave it, its people will be enriched and their goodness increased. The house in which the Quran is not recited is attended by the devils, the angels leave it, its people will be impoverished and their goodness will decrease.\u201d (Mu\u1e63annaf Ibn Ab\u012b Shaybah 30023)\n\n\n\"[Whoever recites a letter] from Allah's Book, then he receives the reward from it, and the reward of ten the like of it. I do not say that Alif Lam Mim is a letter, but Alif is a letter, Lam is a letter and Mim is a letter.\" (Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2910, Book 45, Hadith 36)\n\nBrother\/ Sister, as can be seen from these hadiths, the importance of reading the Qur'an is very significant. From now on, set a daily reading goal and make sure that you read it, Insha'Allah, so that you won't be deprived of these rewards and beauties.\ud83d\ude0a",

Human beings cannot be free from sin, that is, they cannot stay away from it, but the door of repentance is always open.\n\nWe are naturally inclined to commit sin; it is not possible to reduce it to zero. The important thing is to regret the sin and repentance. After repenting of the sins committed, it is important to struggle not to return to those sins. Of course, it is necessary to set the background for this, otherwise repenting and staying in those bad environments and not changing the environment of bad friends will cause you to return to those sins again.\n\nWhile repenting, we must also leave the people and environments that lead us to sin. Again, the Hadiths emphasize the importance of being in a community or group of people who share the same idea as you. Especially in the end times of the universe, we need to be with people who constantly remind us of the hereafter and lead us to the truth, otherwise we cannot stand alone against the flood of sins, brother.\n\nIn short, what you need to do first is a good repentance, then leave whoever or whatever is dragging you into that sin. You need to replace them with righteous people and deeds, and being in the gatherings where truths of faith are talked will be a very beneficial Inshallah brother\/ sister.

Just as a hand that is constantly injured cannot work like a healthy hand, the willpower weakens when it is constantly exposed to sin.\n\nThen we should first try to get away from those sins, look for the reasons, determine whether it is friends or social media that lead us to those sins. First we should get away from the reasons that lead to these sins, and then we should try to strengthen the willpower. For example, in Risale-i Nur it is mentioned that \"just as prayer and tawakkul strengthen the inclination to good, repentance and supplication cut the inclination to evil and break its transgression.\u201d.\n\nThis means that prayer and tawakkul strengthen the will to do good deeds. Repentance and confession to Allah also strengthen the will to keep us away from sin. At the same time, trying to progress with a community is also beneficial in this sense; we can easily do many things that are difficult to do alone.\n\nWe should not be too hasty in doing these things, because it may not be easy to strengthen a weakened will that has been damaged for years.

In other words, it means sincere repentance where one does not commit that sin again.\n\nOtherwise, breaking repentance in the simplest thing and repenting again, saying that Allah forgives anyway, is an empty repentance.

And let us not forget that one minute of unlawful pleasure destroys one's human identity, one's human virtues. He becomes lower than an animal.\n\nWe may have made a mistake, the world is like that, sometimes we fall and sometimes we get up. The important thing is not to stay where we fall, but to manage to get up. What you have to do now is to stand up with repentance and protect your family and try not to fall into the same sin again.

        "cevap": "Brother\/ Sister, because of the worldly occupations in our lives, we can sometimes get confused and our minds keep thinking about the events of the day. Therefore, it is very normal in that situation that when we pray, we do not get any pleasure from our prayers. It is because of our distracted state of mind. Think of it like this: you have a favorite food, but at a time when you are busy, you eat it quickly and get up right away, so you don't realize what you have just eaten. Salah is just like that. \n\nWhen you are busy, when your mind is full, when time is short, you don't feel much of salah. But just as we don't stop eating even if we don't enjoy it, we shouldn't stop praying just because we don't get pleasure from it. Because both are needs and obligations for people to live.\n\nOf course, there will be times when we get so much pleasure from Salah, but it will not always continue like this, because this is the world, this is the place where people are tested. It will continue with ups and downs so that it has meaning. Sometimes this pleasure is taken away from us so that our sincerity, our ikhlas, is measured. It is as if our Rabb is testing us to see if we are praying for pleasure or for his sake. At such times, we must perform our prayers for the sake of our Rabb, even if we do not want to.\n\nYour first priority should be to perform the Salah consistently, regardless of the circumstances, and then you can focus on performing it with devotion and seeking pleasure. To do this, it may be useful to perform the prayer in a quiet environment, perform wudu (ablution) before the Adhan, and prepare spiritually for the prayer by doing Istighfar on the sajjada (prayer rug) for a while, thinking of your Rabb, and learning the translations of the Suras you will recite, insha'Allah.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nYou can download this application that will help you be consistent in your prayers.\nhttps:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.sozlerkosku.beste5v2",

Wudu has many physical and spiritual benefits.\n\nA Muslim who performs wudu (ablution) at least 5 times a day is protected from the causes of disease and cleansed from bacterias that cause disease. This is the physical benefit of wudu. The spiritual benefits of ablution are also numerous.\n\nOur Prophet (pbuh) addressed Anas bin Malik: \"My son! Perform your ablution properly so that the guardian angels will love you and your life will be prolonged. Wudu (ablution) is also a light to the face and a joy to the heart. It is a way to be forgiven for small sins.\n\nOur Messenger of Allah (a.s.m.) has stated this as follows: \"There is not a person who performed ablution and did it well, and then offered prayer, but his sins were not forgiven between the prayer he offered and the next.\" ( \u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b 158, \u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 Muslim 227)\n\nAblution is a spiritual weapon of a Muslim. It protects him from bad feelings and desires. It saves him from the influence of evil thoughts and waswasas (whispers) that attack his mind. People who perform wudu (ablution) are often saved from evil and harmful beings for the sake of their ablution.\n\nA hadith states that it is even possible for the one who dies while performing ablution to attain the rank of being a shahid (. It is also stated in the Hadith that the ablution organs of Muslims will be as bright and white as the fourteenth of the moon on the Day of Resurrection, and their faces will be radiant. With all these good tidings and benefits, let's change the way we look at ablution, which takes us 1 minute of our time, and let's stop making Shaytan happy. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb",

Otherwise, the obstacles that our nafs show us are just excuses that can be easily overcome.\n\nWe cannot pretend that nothing has happened when we miss the time of Salah, which is the greatest and most important commandment after faith. If we miss our Salah, we should feel great regret. By not going to Salah on time, we are saying, \"Please don't insist, O Lord. Give your mercy to others. This is what we express through actions.\n\n Yes, we don't say it with our tongues, our hearts tremble if we say it. If we can't get out of bed at the time of Salah, if we can't delay our worldly occupations, if we feel lazy, isn't this the message we are sending to Allah? Just think about it, our Rabb invites us to His presence, calls us to prostration where He will surround us with His love, He calls us to be in His presence, but if we cannot delay the movie we are watching, if we continue to be busy with other things at the moment of salah, how are we going to be a candidate for His jannah (paradise), how can we express our desire to seek Allah's pleasure?? \"When they rise for prayer, they rise lazily, they show off to people, and they seldom remember Allah.

Praying 5 times a day takes us 1 hour a day in total, my friend, to spend only 1 hour out of the 24 hours given for the sake of our Rabb's pleasure is actually very few.

Sleeping early in the day will make your battle with Shaytan easier in the morning. And before we go to sleep, let's not eat heavy meals for at least 2 hours, and let\u2019s not use electronic devices for at least 1 hour before going to sleep, let's drink a glass of water so it can help us get up easier. \u270b\ud83c\udffb\n\n2) We should go to bed at about the same time every day and wake up at about the same time every day. This will regulate your sleep schedule, and increase our sleep quality.\n\n3) You should definitely set an alarm clock. And you should pay attention to the following:\n- Set more than one alarm, the more alarms, the more likely you are to wake up.\n- After setting the alarm, put the phone away from you, so that you have to get out of bed in the morning to turn off the alarm. \n- If there's no one around you that you might disturb, I also recommend you turn up the volume of the alarm \ud83d\ude0a \n\n4) When you get out of bed for Fajr prayer, set the water\u2019s temperature at its coldest when you are going to perform wudu (ablution). This will wake up your body.\n5) Be eager to wake up for Fajr and pray sincerely to Allah. Allah does not reject those who are eager to go to His Presence. You can also include Surah Al-Ikhlas, Al-Falaq, An-Nas, Al-Kawthar, and the Ayat al-Kursi in your dua\u2019s before sleep.\n\n6) You can ask one from your family or friends to wake you up \ud83d\ude0a They can wake you up face to face or by phone call.\n\n7) Let's get out of bed as soon as we wake up so we don't fall into the sleep trap \u270b\ud83c\udffb \"'Salat is more beneficial for you than sleep\"\n\nRemember also this hadith:\n\"The two rak'ahs before the Fajr prayer are better than this world and all that it contains.\" (Muslim, Mis\u00e2fir\u00een, 96, 97; Tirmidhi, Sal\u00e2t, 190) \nI also recommend you to watch our video\n\ud83e\udd17\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TrKp689eFvU \n\n\n\nFor Isha prayer, perform it as soon as you hear the Adhan (call to prayer) if you can, this way it will not be hard on your nafs and you will taste the relief after doing it early and you will try not to do it late from then on. If this is not possible, you should set alarms at 1-hour intervals until late, so that you don't fall into the \"sleep\" trap.\n\nAs soon as you hear the adhan, run to the prayer room without procrastinating, without saying, \"After I finish this, I can pray,\" because the longer you procrastinate, the more Shaytan will try to mess with you.

It is essential to benefit from works and studies that explain the sense and meaning of worship.\n2. The environment we are in may be very bad spiritually. For example, in a place where there is stinking garbage, our nose becomes uncomfortable. Similarly, in a place where sins and bad deeds are committed a lot, we may not be able to enjoy our worship. Because our soul becomes disturbed by them. We should stay away from such bad environments. \n3. An ill person cannot fully enjoy what he eats and drinks. For example, a person with an injured mouth cannot enjoy the taste of the food he eats. Therefore, he should be cured to taste the food. Similarly, the sins we commit wound and sicken our hearts and souls. As a result, we cannot fully enjoy worship. It is the food of the soul. Therefore, it is necessary to be treated from those sins. The treatment of the soul is first to repent and ask for forgiveness, and then to try not to commit those sins again.\nBrother\/ Sister let's thank our Rabb who has given us countless blessings.

        "soru": "Can you prove to me that God exists and that there is an afterlife?",
        "cevap": "*The existence of God* \n\nThere are many proofs of the existence of God. We can understand God's existence by looking at the simplest and most obvious things from the perspective of art. First of all, from atoms to human beings, from cells to galaxies, there is a delicate and wonderful art in the whole universe. \n\nYes, every single thing in the universe has the following characteristics:\n- It has great artistic value.\n- It is very precious.\n- It is made very quickly and very easily.\n- It is made in large numbers.\n- It is complex and varied.\n- It is continuous.\n\nBut in the arts and works that are done in a short time, in large numbers, and that are simple but complicated, there should be no art and no value. But when Allah is the author, which means the creator, everything changes. Everything becomes possible!\n\nFor example, if a pen, ink and paper are brought together, can they write a book no matter how much time is given by themselves? What are the chances that it will happen by itself? Even a pen must have a writer. So, is it wise to give the entire universe and its wonderful works of art to the atoms that are blind, deaf, and lacking in knowledge and will?\n\nWhat can make a pen to create itself? If we look around us and at ourselves, there are so many beings that are constantly being renewed and created. There must be a Creator who creates and manages them in an order so that there is no chaos. Watch this video on the subject, inshallah \ud83d\ude0a\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/WM6QLkrpy_g?si=lGZEPCz4jl9n9Og9\n\n*Proof of the Hereafter*\n\nIf we look at the reason why the Hereafter must exist, logically, if we look at the creation of this world, we can say that everything was created perfectly out of nothing. So is it more difficult to make something for the first time or to make for the second time what has already been made?\n\nIf he is able to do the first time, of course he is able to do the second time. It would not be reasonable to accept the creation of this world and not accept the creation of the hereafter. If we look at the creation of the baby in the womb, can we say that the baby does not need eyes, ears, hands, and mouth? We know that these organs will be very necessary in the future when the baby is born. Just as the last stage in the womb is an entrance into the world and an opening to it. Similarly, the end in this world is like a door that opens to the hereafter and eternity, brother\/ sister.  Allah is Al-Hakeem,the one in whose works there is no absurdity; everything was created with many aspects of wisdom. Such beautiful beings were not created to vanish into nothingness. It wouldn't make sense for them to be created in a limited way, never live again, and just disappear, right? Many beings come to life and die all within a single minute. There are many beings who are born and die in one minute. It would not be wise for them to be created in order, but then never live, and just disappear, would it? Let's watch this video and put the existence of the afterlife into our logic in a complete way, shall we? \ud83d\ude0a \n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kcFollpOodY",

        "cevap": "Brother\/ Sister, Allah has many names and, one of them is Al-Adl. Since heaven is not cheap and hell is not unnecessary, hell was created to give justice to those who deserve it and to put an end to injustice.\n\nAllah did not create people for Hell; on the contrary, He created Hell for people who deserve it. For example, a government builds a prison, but it does not build it to lock people up for no reason. The government builds the prison to put in those who deserve to be in it. In the same way, Allah has created hell for those who deserve it. Otherwise, to say, \"Allah has prepared Hell for people,\" is not in accordance with the justice and wisdom of his Almighty. Because, if those people never deserved hell, they would have the right to object to not entering it.\n\nOur Lord, the possessor of eternal wisdom and justice, will judge between people with perfect justice and send one group of people to hell and the other to paradise according to what kind of deed they have done in this world, just as He will give the hornless sheep its share from the horned sheep. These are the reasons for the creation of hell.\n\nIn addition, I also recommend you to watch our video below;\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/S-kXnAEB69A?si=3ioC5tmimSpm1oNl",

This has nothing to do with idolatry. When Muslims perform tawaaf the Kaaba, they do not ask or expect anything from it. In idolatry, there is a situation of seeking help and asking for something from non-living things.\n\nThis is not the way a Muslim looks at the Ka\u2019bah. This is not the reason why a muslim visits the Ka'bah. By researching and looking at what idolatry is, you can understand that going around the Kaaba is not for the meaning of Idolatry.",

        "soru": "Why doesn't Allah prevent evil?",
        "cevap": "First, the creation of evil is not evil; the act of choosing evil is evil. For example, there are many reasons for the creation of a knife, right? We can use it for many good things, such as cutting vegetables,fruits and cooking.\n\nBut if a person uses that knife to harm someone, can we say, \"What a bad thing this knife was made for, I wish Allah had never created it,\" can we say that? We cannot, because that would be the responsibility and harm of the person who uses the knife to inflict harm. Allah created human beings to worship Him and commanded them to stay away from evil and bad deeds. Allah has decreed that He will punish those who disobey Him with severe punishment, and He has sent more than a hundred thousand prophets to warn people about all matters. \n\nOf course, people who do not fulfill their duties and ignore these commands will be punished for their actions. The reason why Allah does not directly prevent evil in this world is because we are in a world of trial and testing. This world is a testing place, and both those who do wrong and those who do right are given permission. If those who do wrong were prevented by Allah, this trial would be meaningless.\n\nIf roses were scattered on the heads of those who do good deeds and stones were thrown on the heads of those who sin, this world would no longer be a testing ground.

        "cevap": "Allah Almighty said, \"...if you are afraid you will fail to maintain justice, then \u02f9content yourselves with\u02fa one...\" (Surah An-Nisa, 4\/3)\n\nBased on this verse, polygamy is not obligatory. While monogamy is the main thing, we can say that up to 4 wives are allowed due to some reasons and this also depends on some conditions. We can give the example of war. \n\nThe matter of marrying four wives does not mean that marrying four wives is a neccesity. The right and main thing is to marry one wife. However, the verse shows that it is permissible to marry two, three, or four wives if all conditions are fulfilled.\n\nDuring the period when Islam expanded to the Arabian Peninsula, certain customs from the jahiliyyah (the days of ignorance before Islam) continued to have a strong influence. Some traditions were completely abolished by Islam, while others were moderated. One of them was the issue of unlimited marriages in the Jahiliyyah period. was declared that a maximum of four women could be married. Before Islam came to the Arabian Peninsula, men were allowed to marry any number of women without restriction. Indeed, the Holy Qur'an placed a limit on this pre-Islamic practice. It said that one could marry up to four women. So we can say that Islam wisely put a limit on what was previously unlimited.\n\nIn addition, you can watch this video\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0xY5SAcXtj0",

        "cevap": "First of all, our Creator isn't in need of creating the universe or doesn\u2019t need us. Not all actions are based on some needs. For example, a poet does not write poetry because he has a need to write it; it does not fulfill any need of his. Similarly, when a painter paints, he does not do so out of need. Rather, this poet and painter produce art to demonstrate their own abilities.\n\nSimilarly, Allah does not need the universe, nor doesn\u2019t have such a need. Allah Almighty wanted us to see the manifestations and reflections of His infinite power, knowledge and wisdom, as well as His 99 names and attributes.  For this purpose, He created thousands of kinds of beings, so to speak. \n\nYes, just as a skilled person wants to see and show his skill, Allah wanted to see His attributes of infinite beauty and perfection first and foremost, and He created His creatures to see them.  And then He showed this art to conscious beings. Allah did not create beings out of necessity, but for a divine and exalted satisfaction befitting Him.

        "soru": "We cannot understand the Holy Quran. If we need tafsir and hadith in order not to misunderstand, why was the Holy Quran sent? Was it not sent for human beings?",
        "cevap": "Holy Qur'an is a manifestation of Allah's infinite knowledge. It would not be correct to interpret the Qur'an as a book whose knowledge can be fully known by anyone, scholar or ignorant. \n\nAccording to the meaning accepted by the majority of scholars, the meaning of a verse is as follows.\n\u201c...And no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allah. But those firm in knowledge say, \u201cWe believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.\u201d And no one will be reminded except those of understanding.\u201d (Surah Al- Imran, 3\/7)\n\n\u2018\u2019And these examples We present to the people, but none will understand them except those of knowledge\u2019\u2019 (Surah Al- \u2018Ankabut, 29\/43).\n\n\u2018\u2019Say, (O Prophet,) Are those who know equal to those who do not know ?. None will be mindful (of this) except the people of reason.\u2019\u2019\n(Surah Az-Zumar, 39\/9)\n\nThe fact that the Holy Qur'an is the source of new and new truths every day, that it makes itself young in terms of its scope in proportion to the aging of time, and that it informs its addressee by different truths; the fact that, despite such advances in scientific knowledge, researchers still discover unexplored areas in the Holy Qur'an every day that need to be explained and analyzed. This shows that the concept of \"clarity\" in question is not as clear as it is thought to be, it has other meanings.\n\nThat is, the fact that the Qur'an has a clear statement does not mean that it is in such a way that everyone can understand every part of it immediately. The Qur'an clearly states that Prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) role was not only to deliver the message but also to explain the Qur'an. This shows the fact. Throughout history, Islamic scholars have continued both the duty of conveying, as Prophet Muhammad did, and the duty of explaining\/clarifying the Qur'an so that we can understand it and apply it to our lives.",

        "soru": "We say that God created everything and that nothing exists by itself, but we believe in a God who is self-existed. Isn't that a contradiction? If nothing happens spontaneously and if there is a need for a Creator, how does the Creator come into existence by himself?",
        "cevap": "Brother\/ Sister, first of all, the fact that nothing can exist by itself applies to created beings. Since we are created according to time and space, we cannot attribute this to the Creator. Because the Creator is not like His creation. Let's think of a stove. If you ask that stove, what kind of thing is it that created it? It will probably say that it is a heat-resistant being with a lot of iron. That is all the stove has seen in its world. But just as the one who made the stove is not like the stove, the one who created us will not be like us and will have to be beyond time and space. The existence of Allah (swt) is self-existent, that is, it is of Himself. It is eternal and everlasting. He has no equal or similar. If the process of creation is attributed to a being who created everything and everything depends on Him, a contradiction arises. Then the truths must change into their opposite. If it is believed that Allah Almighty was created - God forbid - then this sacred Being must be both eternal and created (later), both Creator and creation, both infinitely powerful and infinitely powerless. In short, in this situation, He must possess both the infinite perfect attributes of divinity and the endless deficient attributes of a creation.\n\nImagine a train with ten or fifteen wagons. Each of these wagons is pulled by the previous wagon. And finally, when it comes to the locomotives, the question \"Who pulls the locomotive?\" can no longer be asked. Because if there is no motor pulling but not being pulled, this order is broken and there is no movement.\n\nA soldier takes orders from the corporal, the corporal from the captain, and the commander-in-chief from the sultan\/emperor. You cannot ask the question, \"Who gives orders to the sultan?\u2019\u2019 In fact, if the sultan also receives orders from someone, he descends to the rank of a soldier, and the one who gives the orders becomes the sultan. So the sultan isn't a soldier, so you can't really ask, \"Who is the sultan taking orders from? When we think of a sultan, we think of a ruler who gives orders, but doesn't take orders.\nAs can be understood from these examples, the creation of this universe necessarily depends on the knowledge, will, and power of only one being: \u201cAllah\u2019, who is eternal and everlasting in His essence, names, and attributes.\n\nYou can also watch this video\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=efu3rgFOgMg",

Accursed devil (or the evil one, as some people call him \ud83d\ude0f) has nothing else to do; we are his worst enemy. It's his hobby to make us unhappy at any moment, so don't think of it as \"What do these thoughts have to do with religion and the devil?\" because after a while, those delusion become a disease and penetrate into every area of one's life (first and foremost, prayers). My brothers and sisters, who wait in vain in the queues for psychiatrists and look for a cure in drugs! I assure you that you will not get well like this because the cure of this disease is not the doctors who do not know what your problem is and temporarily numb you with drugs. Let's have a look at a few types of delusions one by one:\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If you keep thinking that there is a dry place left while making wudu and you make wudu again and again, you do something that our religion does not want. If there is a dry place left but if you are not absolutely sure that there is, you regard that place as if it has been washed. You can decide about its certainty as follows: Can you swear that it has been left dry?\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If you are not sure that you have washed it three times in wudu, do not wash it again because it is enough to wash it once to fulfil the fard (what is obligatory) anyway.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 There is no such thing as performing a prayer again and again in our religion. In other words, a prayer is not performed again unless there is something missing in its fard parts. For example, if you perform the 4-rak'ah fard of the afternoon prayer (asr) as 3 rak'ahs, you have to perform it again because the fard is incomplete. But if you are a delusional person, the condition is to be certainly sure. You should be sure enough to swear. If there is a delusion such as whether you have performed three or four rak'ahs, the thing to do is clear: it is definitely not to perform the prayer again. If you are doubtful about how many rak'ahs you have performed, continue with the rak'ah closest to your heart. If the idea that you are in the fourth rak'ah prevails, continue with the fourth rak'ah and perform sajdah as-sahw (prostration of forgetfulness) at the end of the prayer. If you can't decide, you continue from the part you are sure of. Let me explain with an example: Suppose that you're not sure if you're in the 3rd or 4th rak'ah. You can't decide at all; neither of them overweighs. But you are sure that you sat in the second rak'ah; that is, you have definitely performed two rak'ahs. In that case you continue as if you are in the 3rd rak'ah. There is just one more thing: you will sit in both rak'ahs after that. In other words, continue as if it is the 3rd rak'ah but do not stand up after prostration; sit and read at-tahiyyatu after prostration; after that, stand up for the 4th rak'ah and perform it; then, sit down again and perform sajdah as-sahw. If I haven't explained it clearly enough, you can search it on the internet.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Let's have a look at the delusion about intention. Intention is not one of the fards of wudu. There are four fards of wudu. Similarly, intention is not a fard of ghusl either, according to Hanafi madhhab; for example, if you go into the sea with your whole body and rinse your mouth and nose, it will be ghusl for you. Don't be stuck on intention. Say \"I make intention to make ghusl for the sake of Allah\" only once; do not repeat it after that. Don't think that it's not from the heart; don't worry about not being able to concentrate fully; Do it just once and keep going, okay? In prayer, intention is fard, but even turning to the qibla to pray is the evidence of your intention; it shows your intention. Make intention only once and don't heed the delusions such as \" It's not quite complete...\", \"It doesn't seem as if it is from the heart...\", \"I don't seem to have concentrated...\" Thus, the delusion will go away from you, inshaAllah, and you will not have such a problem.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 My troubled brother\/sister, who can't get out of the bathroom for hours and whose skin gets wrinkled while making ghusl! You probably mistake the states that necessitate ghusl with those that necessitate wudu. For example, going to the toilet does not necessitate ghusl. Read the states that necessitate ghusl from ilm al-hal books and see if the reason why you constantly make ghusl exists among them. \ud83d\ude09 My sisters! Do not hesitate to search for unusual things about yourselves; you are one of the reasons that caused me to write this article. I specifically state that some conditions peculiar to men are not seen in women in the same way as they occur in men. Although the names are the same; their occurrence in women is very different; it is much more difficult; that is, it is not something easy. If you have delusions about them, make sure to search.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Finally, let me talk about this: I have brothers and sisters who constantly suspect that their wudu is broken. If it is a thought such as \"I wonder...\", that is, if it is not certain enough to swear, it is a delusion. For example, a friend of mine said that he was tested about it while he was on umrah, that he constantly made wudu and still had doubts. He thought whether he was circumambulating the Kaaba without wudu and he mentioned some unpleasant situations. It is one of the most common delusions. Let's see what our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) says to those who have delusions regarding the issue:\n\n\n\ud83d\udc40 \"Do not make wudu because of things that you cannot hear or smell.\" (1)\n\n\n\u2934 (It is valid for the delusional state; that is, if you are not sure.)\n\n\nYes, my brothers\/sisters, those who have not experienced delusion cannot know what a problem it is. You may have noticed that the delusions about worship are always based on lack of knowledge. As Bediuzzaman Said Nursi puts it, \"These scruples (delusions) are such that ignorance invites them and knowledge repulses them.\" Knowledge of ilm al-hal is something every Muslim should know, but unfortunately, we lack it. When such a question comes to your mind and when you have delusions about worship, search definitely for the answer to your question and problem. For these questions, I recommend you the site \"https:\/\/questionsonislam.com\", where you can find answers from authorized people. As you learn and act according to your knowledge, inshaAllah you will attain salvation.\n\n\nI would also like to share with you a very important part of the Risale-i Nur tafsir:\n\n\n\ud83c\udf39 \"Friend! While walking through the darkness of delusions and scruples, I saw that the Sunnahs of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) acted as stars and lamps. Every sunnah or a religious penalty shines like the sun on the paths of dark aberration. If man deviates from those sunnahs slightly, he will be a toy for devils, mount for delusions, place for fears and carrier for the loads as heavy as mountains.\n\n\nI also saw those sunnahs as if they were ropes coming down from the sky; those who keep hold of them rise and attain happiness. Those who oppose them and rely on intellect will become a pharaoh like the Pharaoh, who acted so stupidly as to try to ascend to the sky with a tall minaret\u2026\n\n\n\"Three of my friends I met this summer complained to me about delusions that occurred related to worship; I was amazed by the divine coincidence. They are all unconnected with one another... How many friends do you meet in the summer anyway? Probably five or so. You know when you plan on the last day of school \"We'll meet for sure in the summer, we'll have fun all day dude. \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d \" But you don't see them until the first day of school. \ud83d\ude02\n\nDelusion is such a thing that if one ends, a different one begins. I can say like a chameleon but the shape of the chameleon is definite; it only changes color. \ud83d\ude15 This delusion is like the flu bug; if you produce an antibody to one and gain immunity, it will take a different form and trouble you again. Things about belief; strange, nonsensical and nasty dreams \"What if it's like this or that...\" and similar unnecessary questions\u2026 And it causes pangs of conscience. \ud83d\ude21 But our Lord, whose mercy is endless, only wants ease for us; don't say I wonder if my worship is complete; Allah will not ask you whether He will accept it or not.\n\n\ud83d\udc95 \"... Allah intends every facility for you; He does not want to put you to difficulties.\" (al-Baqara 185),\n\nBesides, Allah knows your heart and intention. Who can be more merciful to a servant than his Lord? Who can understand your situation better than him?\n\nBadiuzzaman Said Nursi says:\n\n\ud83c\udf52 \" That is, it is better if such a person sees his action as faulty and seeks forgiveness, rather than considering it to be good and falling into pride; since it is thus, throw away your scruples and say to Satan: \"This state is a difficulty. It is difficult to be aware of the reality of things. It is contrary to the ease in religion expressed by:\n\n\u0627\u064e\u0644\u062f\u0651\u06ea\u064a\u0646\u064f \u064a\u064f\u0633\u0652\u0631\u064c \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e \u0641\u0650\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0651\u06ea\u064a\u0646\u0650\n\nCertainly such an action is conformable with a true school of law. That is enough for me. And at least by admitting my inability to perform the worship in a way worthy of it, it is a means of taking refuge with Divine compassion through humbly beseeching forgiveness, and to meekly supplicating that my faulty actions be accepted.\"(2)\n\n\u26a0Again, a very, very important piece of information you need to know is that Badiuzzaman Said Nursi stays the following about delusion:\n\n\ud83d\udd0a \"However, the only way to defeat and repel them is to abandon the defense and not deal with them. Yes, if you struggle with bees, they will increase their attacks; if you ignore them, they will leave you alone. \" (3)\n\nMy brothers\/sisters! This is really the only remedy for delusion. Do not expect to get rid of it otherwise. Every feeling that our Lord gave us has a reason and a place to use it correctly. We have a very cool feeling that we should use against delusions: insensitivity. That is, not to care, not to be busy with, to ignore and to pretend not to hear at all.\n\nAs I end my words, shall I tell you the cure for all kinds of delusions? Write it down and hang it on the wall before your eyes. Whenever you have delusions, repeat it to yourself, over and over again. Read it over and over again until you get better because the need recurs. Read the second station of the 21st Word from Risale-i Nur. This cure is the first part of that station, and it is a remedy for every delusion, alhamdulillah, from the pharmacy of the Quran.\n\n\ud83c\udf38\" O one afflicted with the sickness of scruples! Do you know what your scruples resemble? A calamity! The more importance they are given, the more they grow. If you give them no importance, they die away. If you see them as big, they grow bigger. If you see them as small, they grow smaller. If you fear them, they swell and make you ill. If you do not fear them, they are light and remain hidden. If you do not know their true nature, they persist and become established. While if you do know them and recognize them, they disappear.\"(4)\n\n\nMay Allah bless you...\n\n\nAs-Salamu Alaikum \ud83c\udf88\n\nYou can also watch this video: https:\/\/youtu.be\/93kjPt6ajaA\n\n\nReferences\n(1) Hadith | Muslim, Hayd, 99 (362); see Bukhari, Wudu, 4, 36)\n(2)Risale-i Nur Tafseer\n(3)Risale-i Nur\n(4)Risale-i Nur \",",

The most effective way to start performing prayers is to make wudu and lay the prayer mat immediately. :) It will be more difficult for your soul with every second you postpone; as you postpone, you will postpone more and more. Prayer is the pillar of the religion of Islam. It is the call of your Lord, who surrounds you with His endless blessings, to His presence 5 times a day. It is a comprehensive gratitude for all His blessings on you. \\nIt is like  saying, 'My Lord! I haven't forgotten you by being involved in worldly affairs.' So. don't delay anymore brother!
